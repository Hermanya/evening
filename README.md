Collaborative Blog as a Project Managment tool
==
This project is **currently offline**.

> ***Tl;dr:*** a closed colloborative blogging platform with its own markdown flavor, media uploads and a task managment system. 

> It's supposed to have GitHub integration, so that non-GitHub people could avoid Github, but the integration is not ready yet.

Initially it was developed for a team of very different people, who had one goal. 


They were developing a game. As you may guess, to develop a game you need a programmer, who may have ideas on how the development process should look like. An artist, who can draw awesome characters, but has no idea about GitHub. A musician, who has ideas, on how the game should look like, but unfortunately he can't draw. And, say, a leader, whose initial idea it was. He loves good music and knows about some cutting edge technologies, so he may help the developer to design the architeture.

They would need a place to share their ideas, progress reports and ask for help.
